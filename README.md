This is an Authentication application in which a basic authorization proccess is done like creating/ registering an user require username emial and passwords. 
After that the registered user is data is stored in database and while loging the username and password should match with eachother with the datbase data(username, password).

This simple application is created with Django inbuilt functions like auth, user model, authentications, login and logout.

I created this for getting knowledge on how the auth actually works on django.
